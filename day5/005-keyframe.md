CSS keyframe animations allow for complex animations to be created in CSS by setting multiple stages for the animation, which are defined by keyframes.

### What are CSS Keyframe Animations?

CSS keyframe animations consist of two main parts:

1. **Keyframes**: These define the sequence of styles that the animation will go through. Each keyframe is represented by a percentage, indicating at which point during the animation's duration it should be applied.

2. **Animation Properties**: These are applied to the element you want to animate and determine how the animation should behave. Some of the most common properties include:
   - `animation-name`: Specifies the name of the keyframes you want to bind to the element.
   - `animation-duration`: Defines how long the animation should take from start to finish.
   - `animation-timing-function`: Describes how the intermediate property keyframes are calculated.
   - `animation-delay`: Specifies a delay before the animation starts.
   - `animation-iteration-count`: Determines how many times the animation should run.
   - `animation-direction`: Specifies whether the animation should play in reverse on alternate cycles.
   - `animation-fill-mode`: Defines how the animation applies styles outside of its time frame.

### Example:

Let's create a simple animation where a div element will move horizontally across the screen:

```css
/* Define the keyframes */
@keyframes moveRight {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(300px);
  }
}

/* Apply the animation to the element */
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  
  /* Animation properties */
  animation-name: moveRight;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
```

In this example:

- We've defined a keyframe animation named `moveRight`.
- The animation starts with the `div` at its original position (`translateX(0)`) and ends with it moved 300px to the right (`translateX(300px)`).
- The `div` element has been styled to have a width, height, and background color.
- The animation properties applied to the `div` make it move right over 3 seconds, with an ease-in-out timing function. It will repeat infinitely and move back to its original position on alternate cycles (due to the `alternate` direction).

When this CSS is applied, the `div` will continuously move right and then back to its original position, creating a back-and-forth animation.
