We can debug a web application using the built-in developer tools provided by modern web browsers, which leverage various HTML5 features and APIs. Here's a brief overview of how you can debug a web application:

### 1. **Open Developer Tools**:
- **Chrome**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac).
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac).
- **Safari**: Enable the "Develop" menu from Preferences, then select "Show Web Inspector".
- **Edge**: Press `F12`.

### 2. **Elements Panel**:
Inspect and modify the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS. You can select elements, see their styles, and make live changes to test different styles or DOM structures.

### 3. **Console Panel**:
View logged messages, run JavaScript in the context of the page, and interact with the page's JavaScript objects and variables. You can also see errors and warnings here.

### 4. **Sources Panel**:
Debug your JavaScript using breakpoints. You can step through your code, inspect variables, and see the call stack.

### 5. **Network Panel**:
Monitor and inspect network activity. You can see all the network requests your page makes, view details of each request, and see the data being sent and received.

### 6. **Performance Panel**:
Profile the runtime performance of your page. You can record and analyze how much time is spent in various parts of your code to find bottlenecks.

### 7. **Application Panel**:
Inspect and modify web storage (like Local Storage and Session Storage), IndexedDB databases, and cookies. You can also manage service workers and manifest files for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

### 8. **Security Panel**:
Inspect and debug security issues. You can see details about the SSL certificate, view and manage permissions, and more.

### 9. **Device Emulation**:
Simulate different devices, screen sizes, and resolutions. This is useful for responsive design testing.

### 10. **Accessibility Inspection**:
Check accessibility issues in your web application to ensure it's usable by people with disabilities.

### Tips for Debugging:

1. **Console Logging**: Use `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, `console.error()`, etc., to log information to the console.
2. **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints in your JavaScript to pause execution and inspect the current state.
3. **Watch Expressions**: Add expressions to watch while debugging to see their values in real-time.
4. **Network Throttling**: Simulate slow network conditions to see how your app behaves under constrained bandwidth.
5. **Disable Cache**: While debugging, disable the cache to ensure you're always loading the latest version of your files.

Remember, while the developer tools leverage HTML5 and other web technologies, they are not part of the HTML5 specification itself. They are tools provided by browser vendors to make web development and debugging easier.
