**PHP** stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" (it's a recursive acronym). It is a widely-used, open-source scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### History of PHP:

1. **Early Days (1994)**:
   - PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. Initially, it was a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C programming language. It was called "Personal Home Page Tools" and was used to track visits to Lerdorf's online resume. This is where the name "PHP" originally comes from.

2. **PHP/FI (1995-1997)**:
   - In 1995, Lerdorf released the source code for PHP to the public, which allowed developers to use it and contribute to its development. It evolved into "PHP/FI," which stands for "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter." PHP/FI included capabilities to interact with databases and produce dynamic web content.

3. **PHP 3 (1997-1998)**:
   - Two developers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rewrote the parser in 1997, leading to the creation of PHP 3. This version laid the foundation for PHP as we know it today. It included many new features, improved performance, and support for multiple databases. The name was officially changed to "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor."

4. **PHP 4 (2000-2004)**:
   - PHP 4 was released in May 2000. With this version, the Zend Engine was introduced, which was a significant improvement in terms of performance and reliability. The Zend Engine is a highly optimized execution engine for the PHP scripting language.

5. **PHP 5 (2004-2014)**:
   - Released in July 2004, PHP 5 brought with it many improvements and new features, most notably the introduction of a robust object-oriented programming model. It also included improved MySQL support through the MySQLi extension, better XML and SOAP support, and SQLite support.

6. **PHP 7 (2015-Present)**:
   - PHP 7 was released in December 2015, skipping version 6 due to certain reasons. PHP 7 brought significant performance improvements, reducing memory consumption and increasing speed. It introduced the Zend Engine 3, type declarations, the null coalescing operator, and many other features.

7. **PHP 8 (2020-Present)**:
   - Released in November 2020, PHP 8 introduced several new features, optimizations, and improvements. Notable features include the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, union types, named arguments, and attributes (annotations).


Today, PHP continues to be a dominant force in web development, with a large ecosystem of frameworks (like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter) and content management systems (like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal) built on top of it.
