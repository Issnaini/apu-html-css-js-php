### **What is a Web Server?**

A web server is a software application (or in some cases, hardware) that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to users' browsers over the internet. These web pages are usually in the form of HTML documents, but they can also include images, CSS, JavaScript, and other types of data. The web server communicates using the HTTP protocol, although HTTPS (a secure version of HTTP) is becoming increasingly common.

### **Core Functions of a Web Server**:

1. **Listening to Requests**: A web server constantly listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients, which are typically web browsers.

2. **Processing Requests**: Once it receives a request, the server processes it. This might involve parsing URL parameters, handling sessions, interfacing with databases, and more.

3. **Serving Static Content**: For requests that point to static content (like HTML, CSS, images), the web server retrieves the content from the filesystem and sends it to the client.

4. **Running Server-Side Applications**: For dynamic content, the server may need to execute a script (like PHP, Python, or JavaScript with Node.js) to generate the HTML content on-the-fly.

5. **Setting HTTP Headers**: Web servers add HTTP headers to their responses. These headers provide meta-information about the response, such as content type, content length, caching directives, and more.

6. **Logging**: Almost all web servers maintain logs that record details of every request they handle, such as IP address of the client, resource requested, timestamp, and more.

7. **Handling Security**: This involves features like SSL/TLS for HTTPS, blocking suspicious requests, and potentially integrating with firewalls.

8. **Load Balancing & Traffic Management**: Advanced setups might distribute incoming traffic among several servers to balance the load and ensure high availability.

### **Popular Web Servers in the Market**:

1. **Apache HTTP Server (often called Apache)**
2. **Nginx**
3. **Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)**
4. **LiteSpeed**
5. **Tomcat** (technically an application server, but it can also serve static content)
